### 9.1. Creating a Lion Class Without Any Variables or Methods
#### Definition of the Lion Class Without Variables or Methods
class Lion:
    pass  # Using 'pass' as there is no content in the class


#This Lion class is empty and contains neither variables (attributes) nor methods (functions).
### 9.2. Creating a Lion Class with Variables and Methods
#### Definition of the Lion Class with Variables and Methods
class Lion:
    # Initializing the class variables
    def __init__(self, origin, weight, age, color):
        self.origin = origin  # Variable for the lion's origin
        self.weight = weight  # Variable for the weight
        self.age = age        # Variable for the age
        self.color = color    # Variable for the color

    # Method to make the lion roar
    def roar(self):
        print("The lion roars")

    # Method for the lion to sleep
    def sleep(self):
        print("The lion sleeps")

# Example of using the class
lion1 = Lion("Africa", 200, 5, "golden")  # Creating a Lion object
lion1.roar()  # Calling the roar method
lion1.sleep()  # Calling the sleep method


#The Lion class now contains four variables (origin, weight, age, color) and two methods (roar and sleep).
#### Explanations:

#- In part 9.1, the Lion class is created without any variables or methods. It serves simply as an empty template.
#- In part 9.2, the Lion class is enhanced with four instance variables (origin, weight, age, color) and two methods (roar and sleep). The `__init__` method is a constructor used to initialize the instance variables when creating a Lion object. The methods roar and sleep simulate the behaviors of a lion.
